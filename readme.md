# Song Popularity (using Machine Learning)

## Project Description
This project analyzed a dataset of 30,000 Spotify songs, exploring track characteristics and their influence on popularity and genre classification.

## Problem and Research Questions
The project sought to understand what musical features contribute to a song's popularity and how songs can be accurately classified into genres. Key questions addressed include: What attributes most strongly predicted a song's popularity? How were songs effectively classified into genres based on their attributes?

## Ethical Concerns
The project ensured all data used was anonymized and publicly available, respecting user privacy and Spotify's data usage policies. Potential biases in the dataset were considered, and the implications of the analysis results were responsibly addressed, ensuring compliance with ethical standards and data usage policies.

## Data
- The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, titled “30,000 Spotify Songs”.
- It's approximately 7.6 MB in size, containing 32,834 songs (rows) and 23 features (columns).
- Key features include musical characteristics such as danceability, energy, key, loudness, tempo, and metadata like track name, artist, album, release date, and popularity.
- The dataset focused on track details and characteristics, addressing privacy concerns effectively.

## Methods
- **Data Preprocessing**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Predictive Modeling**: For predicting song popularity and genre classification, various machine learning algorithms were employed.
- **Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction**
- **Model Evaluation and Validation**
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**

## Evaluation
The project was evaluated based on the accuracy of the predictive models for song popularity and genre classification, as well as the insights gained from data analysis.
