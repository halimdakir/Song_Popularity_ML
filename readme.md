# Song Popularity (using Machine Learning)

## Project Description
This project analyzed a dataset of 30,000 Spotify songs, exploring track characteristics and their influence on popularity and genre classification.

## Problem
The project sought to understand what musical features contribute to a song's popularity and how songs can be accurately classified into genres. Key questions addressed include: What attributes most strongly predicted a song's popularity? How were songs effectively classified into genres based on their attributes?

## Ethical Concerns
The project ensured all data used was anonymized and publicly available, respecting user privacy and Spotify's data usage policies. Potential biases in the dataset were considered, and the implications of the analysis results were responsibly addressed, ensuring compliance with ethical standards and data usage policies.

## Data
- The dataset was from Kaggle, titled “30,000 Spotify Songs”.
- It's approximately 7.6 MB in size, containing 32,834 songs (rows) and 23 features (columns).
- Key features include musical characteristics such as danceability, energy, key, loudness, tempo, and metadata like track name, artist, album, release date, and popularity.
- The dataset focused on tracking details and characteristics, addressing privacy concerns effectively.
